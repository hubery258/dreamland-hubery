Welcome to *Hubery's Dreamland*！I'm a first-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Zhejiang University.<br>
I'm not the stereotypical cser who appears purely rational. Alongside my technical pursuits, I am deeply drawn to literature. This site therefore is not only about code and other technical content, but also about literature, reflections, and the everyday musings that shape my world. <br>
For me, Computer Science opens a dreamlike world where I can freely build, create, and express myself————whether in rational or non-rational ways. So I called this site **dreamland**. You're welcome to join me here and share a piece of that dream.<br>

- 🔭 Currently, I'm working on learning *CS61A*,*Coursera: Machine Learning*,*cs50:AI* adn *MIT Calculus Course*
- Hobbies:
    - 💻 **Independent software development**
    - 📚 **Reading and Writing**: My favorite writers are Wang Zengqi and Camus and Foucault.[MY TOP 10](https://www.douban.com/doulist/158260489/)
    - 🛹 **Skateboarding**: now I can do Ollie and Pop Shuvit !
